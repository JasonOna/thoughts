# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building web applications a breeze.

## Key Features

### 1. File-based Routing

Next.js uses the file system for routing. Just create files in the `app` directory and they become routes automatically.

### 2. Server Components

React Server Components are the default in Next.js 13+, providing better performance and smaller bundle sizes.

### 3. Static Site Generation

You can export your entire site as static HTML files, perfect for blogs and documentation sites.

## Installation

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Conclusion

Next.js is an excellent choice for building modern web applications, from simple blogs to complex web apps.
